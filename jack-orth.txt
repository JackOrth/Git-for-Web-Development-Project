Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
        Inline elements don't for a new line to start while block elements create a line break. 

    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 
        It goes away from the normal flow of the document and stays on a layer by itself. 

    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 
        I would use the css property position and give a value of absolute.


    4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
        Display Block:
         1. <div>
         2. <h1>
         3.<p>
        Display inline:
         1. <span>
         2. <a>
        Display Inline Block:
         1. <nav>

    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the "fix" for the box model, in other words, how do we make all elements respect the width we've given them? 
        The box model to me is that each html element on your website is a box. You can then use the box model to your advantage by using padding, borders, and margins to help design your webpage the way you like. The way we make elements respect the width we've given them is by telling them their boxes width or height. You can do this is percentages.
